the higher i want to talk about understanding and the nature of understanding and what the essence of
understanding is because understanding is something we aim for everyone we own we want to understand things my claim is that understanding has to do with the ability to change your perspective if you don't have that you don't have understanding so that is my claim and i want to focus on mathematics men
we of us think of mathematics as addition subtraction multiplication division fractions percent geometry algebra all that stuff but actually i want to talk about the essence of mathematics as well and my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns behind me you see a beautiful pattern and this pattern act
ashley emerges just from drawing circles in a very particular way so my day to day definition of mathematics that i use everyday is the following first of all it is about finding patterns
and with a pattern i mean a connection and a structure some irregularity some rules that govern what we see second of all i think it is about representing these patterns with the language we make up language if we don't have it and in mathematics this is essential
it's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens and we're going to do that very soon and finally it's about doing cool stuff mathematics enables us to do so many things so let's have a look at these patterns if you want to tie a tie not the
there are patterns tie knots have names and you can also do the mathematics of pinal this is a left out right in center out and tie this is the left and right out left instead throughout the entire this is a language we made up for the patterns of tunnels and a half windsor is all that
this is a mathematics book about tying shoelaces at university level because there are patterns in shoelaces you can do it in so many different ways we can analyze it we can make up languages for it
and representations is all over mathematics this is libelous this notation from sixteen seventy five he invented a language for patterns in nature when we throw something up in the air it falls down why we're not sure but we can represent this with mathematics in a pattern
this is also a pattern and this is this is also where an invented language and it can you guess for what
it is actually a notation system for dancing for tap dancing and that enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff to do new things because he has represented it and i want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is here it says the word mathematics
but actually they are just dots right so how in the world can these dots represent the word well they do
they represent the word mathematics and these symbols also represent that word and this we can listen to sounds like this
somehow these sounds represent the word and the concept how does this happen and there's something amazing going on about representing stuff so i want to talk about that magic that happens when we actually represent something here you see it just lines right with differ
with the stem from numbers for a particular book and i can actually recommend this book it is a very nice book just trust me
okay so let's just do an experiment just play around with some straight lines this is a straight line let's make another one so every time we move we move one down and one across and we we draw a new straight line right so we do this over and over and over and we look for patterns so this pattern emerges and it's
rather a nice pattern it looks like a curve right just from drawing simple straight lines american changed my perspective a little bit i can rotate it and then have a look at the curve you know what does it look like is there is it a part of a circle it's actually not the part of a circle so i have to continue my investigation to look for you know the true pattern
and perhaps if i copy it to make some art
well no perhaps i should extend the lines like this and look for the pattern there and let's make more lines you do this and then let's just tomb out and changed our perspective again and then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called the parabola this is represented
by a simple equation at it and it's a beautiful pattern so this is the stuff that we do we we find patterns and we represent them and i think this is a nice day today definition but today i want to go a little bit deeper and think about what is the nature of of this what makes it possible and there's one thing that's a little
bit deeper and that has to do with the ability to change your perspective
and i claim that when you change your perspective and if you take another point of view you learn something new about what you are watching or looking at or hearing and i think this is a really important thing that we do all the time so let's just do look at this simple equation like
explore x equals two times x this is a very nice pattern and it's true because five plus five equals two times five etc if you've seen this over and over and the represented like this but think about it this is an equation it says that something is equal to something else and that's two different perspectives one perspective is it's some it's something you
plus together on the other hand it's a multiplication and those are two different perspectives and i would go as far as to say that every equation is like this every mathematical equations were used that sign that equality sign is actually a metaphor it's an analogy between two things you're just viewing something
and taking two different points of view and you're expressing that in the language have a look at this equation this is one of the most beautiful equations and it's implicit that well two things they're both negative one this this thing on the left hand side is nobody one and the other one is and that i think is one of the essential parts of method
you take different points of view let's just play around let's take a number you know we know for thirds we know what four thirds this is one point three three three but we have to have those three dots of what is not exactly four thirds but this is only in base ten you know the number system we used ten digits if we chased us around and only use two digits that's called the
binary system it's written like this so we're now talking about the number the number is four thirds and we can write it like this and we can just change the base changed the number of digits and we can write it differently so these are all representations of the same number we can even write it simply like one point three
you are one point six it all depends on how many digits you have or perhaps we should simplify and just write it like this i like this one because this is poor divided by three and this number expresses a relation between two numbers you have four on the one hand and three on the other and you can visualize this in many ways and what i'm doing now is i'm viewing the
that number from different perspectives and playing around and playing around with how we view something and i'm doing it very deliberately we can take a grid if it's four across and three up this line equals five always it has to be like this this is a beautiful pattern for one three and five and this rectangle which is four by
three you've seen a lot of times this is your average computer screen eight hundred by six hundred or sixty and one hundred by twelve hundred is the tv or the or a computer screen so these are all nice representations but i want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number here you see two circles and i'm going to rotate them like this and up
reserve the upper left one it goes a little bit faster right you can see this and it actually goes exactly four thirds this fast and that means that when it goes around four times the other one goes around three times now let's make two lines and draw the dot where the lines meet we get this dancing dot around and this dot comes from that number
ever
right now we should trace it let's trace it and see what happens this is what mathematics is all about it's about seeing what happens and this emerges from four thirds i like to say that this is the image of four thirds is very much nicer thank you the
this is not new this has been offered for a long time but the but this is for thirds let's do another experiment let's now
take a sound sound this is a perfect a four hundred and forty hertz let's multiply it by two because we play played together
a lot of what they're going to this game we can play a sound with semi can multiply it by three halves
this is called what we call a perfect fifth or nice together let's multiply this one by four thirds right what happens
you get this one this is the perfect fourth if the first one is an a this is a d or selling this together this is the sound of four thirds what i'm doing now i'm changing my perspective i'm just viewing a number from another perspective i can even do this with rhythms right i can take a rhythm and play three bits at once
in a period of time and i can play another sound four times in that same space
it sounds kind of boring but listen to them together
hey so
i can even make a little highest
here this so this is the sound of four thirds
as a rhythm
and i can keep doing this and play games with numbers or third is a really great number i love for thirds
truly undervalued number will so if you take a sphere and look at the volume of the sphere it's actually four thirds of some particular cylinder so four thirds is in the sphere is the volume of the sphere okay so why am i doing all this well i want to talk about what it means to understand something and what do we mean by understand
adding something that's my aim here and my claim is that you understand something if you have the ability to view it from different perspectives let's look at this letter is a beautiful are right how do you know that well as a matter of fact you've seen a bunch of arts and you've generalized and abstracted over all this and you've found a pattern so you know that is
isn't this is an r
so what what i'm aiming for here saying something about how understanding and changing your perspective is linked and i'm a teacher and i'm a lecturer and i can actually use this to teach something because when i give someone else another story a metaphor and analogy if i tell a story from a different point of view i
i enable understanding i make understanding possible because you have to generalize over everything you see and hear and if i give you another perspective that will become easier for you let's do a simple example again this is four and three this is for triangles so this is also for thurs in a way let's just join them together now we are
going to play a game we are going to fold it up into a three dimensional structure i love this this is a square pyramid again and let's just take two of them and just put them together okay so this is what is called the octahedron it's one of the five platonic solids now we can quite literally changed our perspective because we can rotate it round one
one of the axis and view it from different perspectives and i can change the axis and then i commute from another point of view but it's the same thing but it looks a little different and i can do it even one more time every time i do this something else appears so i'm actually learning more about the object when that changed my perspective i can use this as the
a tool for creating understanding
i can take two of these and just put them together like like this and see what happens and it looks a little bit like the octahedron have a look at that if i spin it around like this what happens well if you take two of these join them together and spin it around there's your octahedron again a beautiful structure if you lie
laid out flat on the floor this is the octahedron this is the graph structure of an octahedron and you can even i can continue doing this you can draw three great circles around the octahedron and they rotate around so actually three great circles is related to the octahedron in a particular bicycle pump
just pump it up you can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron is do you see what i'm doing here i am changing the perspective all the time
so let's now take a step back and that that's actually a metaphor stepping back
and have a look at what we are doing and playing around with metaphors and playing around with perspectives and analogies and telling one story in different ways and telling stories and making a narrative in american several narratives and i think all these things makes understanding possible i think this actually is the essence of understanding something
i truly believe this so this thinking about changing your perspective it's absolutely fundamental for humans let's play around with this earth this room into the ocean have a look at the ocean we can do this with anything we can take the ocean and view it up close we can look at the waves we can go to the beach we can view the ocean from another
perspective every time we do this we learn a little bit more about the ocean if you go to the shore we can kind of smell it right we can hear the sound of the waves you can feel the salt on our tongues so all these are different perspective and this is the best one we can go into the water we can see the water from the inside and you know what this is absolutely essential
central in mathematics and computer science if you are able to view structure from the inside then you really learned something about it the some of the essence of something so when we do this and we've taken this journey into the ocean b use our imagination and i think this is one level deeper
and it's actually a requirement for changing your perspective let's we can do a little game you can actually imagine that you're sitting there you can imagine that your appear and that you're sitting here you can view yourselves from the outside that's really a strange thing you're changing your perspective you're using your imagination and you're reviewing yourself
from the outside and that requires imagination and mathematics and computer science is the most imaginative art forms ever
and this thing about changing perspectives should sound a little bit familiar to you
because we do it every day
and then it's called empathy
when i view the world from your perspective
i have empathy with you if i really truly understand what the world looks like from your perspective i am empathetic that requires imagination and that is how we obtain understanding
and this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science and there's a really deep connection with we between empathy and these sciences
so my conclusion is the following
understanding something really deeply has to do with the ability to change your perspective
so my advice to you is try to change your perspective you can just study mathematics it's a wonderful way to train your brain
changing your perspective makes you makes your mind more flexible it makes you open to new things and it makes you it makes you able to understand things and use yet another metaphor it'll have a mind like water that's nice thank you

Summary:
Understanding is centered around the ability to change one's perspective, which is essential in mathematics. Mathematics is more than just numbers and equations; it is about finding patterns and representing them. By changing our perspective, we can discover new patterns and represent them in different ways.

One way to understand the concept of perspective is through the example of a straight line which, when repeated, creates a curve known as a parabola. By rotating and extending these lines, we can uncover the true pattern and represent it with a simple equation. This process of finding patterns and representing them is the essence of mathematics.

The ability to change perspectives is not limited to mathematics. We can also change our perspectives in various areas such as language, music, and art. Through different perspectives, we can understand concepts and ideas from new angles, opening our minds to new possibilities.

Furthermore, understanding is closely linked to empathy. When we put ourselves in someone else's shoes and view the world from their perspective, we develop empathy and understanding. This imaginative exercise is also essential in mathematics and computer science, as it helps us understand structures from the inside and gain a deeper comprehension of them.

In conclusion, understanding requires the ability to change perspectives. By doing so, we enhance our flexibility of mind, open ourselves to new ideas, and develop a deeper understanding of the world around us. Mathematics is a powerful tool to train our brains in changing perspectives and developing empathy, ultimately leading to a broader understanding of the world.
