Learning from Rickshaw Boy
When I was a child, a traditional culture in Chinese is everyone should study, whatever the type of study, useful or it seems like un-useful, like play basketball, summing, or developing brain which is like math, traditional Chinese and so on, parents always have many expect to kids who are legal child.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to me that learning some skills or learning somethings, reading book and watching tv is one of the difficult choices, it's not about interest, I canâ€™t understand a lot of books though these stories what talk about. That's not such a bad thing, unexpected reading and learning some depth things is more easily to me, newspaper or TV news attracted me deeply.
One day I caught one book named Rickshaw Boy, so surprise that I can understand and feel the stories in the book, Rickshaw Boy is a novel that its text is not obscure, and the ideas it is intended to convey are easy to understand, but might so hard to understand for who are as age as me is difficultly.
