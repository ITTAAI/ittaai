This is what the professor saidparents didn't they're not all so out or we wish we were socially and about it because
draw for you a new out there is a little extra
oh really
at his eyes on
i said you seriously
i recently
summary
many people last summer are it's not hot summer in it's own media really get business within other than of his summary on are you serious
ever need it you can yeah
pursuit to forget what can you watch and his is over
what would it be done for love
your mom isn't because you got into each other and we are you able to be watching lot to need to new york or two well go look at these numbers
yeah but do you really are
okay
like there
some cats
it was in not voters
it's is judge you male model
well doing held you know
atlanta
yeah
yeah
yeah
was
hi
all
worth
no
right
for them
really
and are now
you
it's probably are
it was a beginner not
ever do to a me
the that usable gentle your coma
male
hall
usual up they hurt you about
yeah made movie she never easy that you
huh
have many more
right
on origin
say
one of those
yeah all
yeah it's hot desert
love
the bible up so hours
in early
of
le
rossi
hello
why hundred do this
every it you wouldn't wouldn't
obama is a reality
week i guess i
we'll get some good one
right
or do i you completely that again like it
has it all your eyes
more on
i made it boy
right
um
i forgot you're gonna
real
oil
learn what you going you open your liver
we gonna happen it's necessary
was
i
of
a lot more
so
oh wait
so
i
with
yeah hillary that of it
it was horrible
and that
are you doing
that would accomplish
listen
this
the got married with good
on another day cycle went
which way you look closely but
This is what the professor saidif
plotting different functions and your from windows but even there
when i showed your earlier could have been a bit misleading because it looked like a linear graph and the exponential graph grew at different levels but we didn't have a clear sense of that because we did
changed the scales scale on the y axis for the linear graph only went up to thirty the scale in the y axis for the exponential grab one of two hundred forty thousand and
like to be able to better visualize differences so the scales are different on the grass how can we deal with that
one option is to explicitly settle
right now we're just letting car lab do that automatically it figures out what's the maximum range of why values and assess the axe a scale approach
we control
a second option is to actually plot multiple functions on the same display but to choose which ones i wanted to split with
when we put off for together and we saw that that was a really effective because the smallest ones were too small but now look at how we might do a different way of doing that multiple displays season
car
haven't seen wearing a bright orange you're just and now i can explicitly saying i want to have a wide limit
picking up because i happen to know what displays going to look like
some experimentation might let you decide an appropriate said
what you should see here is a when i am plotting i have the ability to explicitly sap the range on the y axis by the way i could set the same thing on the x axis
i don't have to show all of the guys the wife function or the eggs i could actually pull out just a subset of it
so in this case i'm gonna do a plot
plot the clutch out each in their own free i'm got a set the why limit to be the same and of frames and then i label them
what happens on we do that
this is actually quite nice
why
because it's he wants
what about
what
rapidly but now we get a sense of that difference
as i said
y axis have the same range
though it is also i picked a value that has a little bit of a gap up here
i know that the why those
i could have lowered it down but this was a nice way of thinking arrangement was gonna let me see got different
from the perspective of visualizing data this is nice
because no one really care how quickly just quite a quite dramatic grow old too linear while still seeing the difference
what else might i
for like one overlay the plot on top of one another
but do it in a way where i actually pick which ones on one thing
massage earlier that
let your kids watch the match was gonna be a wash as you'll never see the linear but now i can go back to the idea of set up
if function are fighting and
and then this case less plot to functions inside that frame
take a second one cleared and plot another
if i do that
game because i'm calling also those plots inside of the same figure they're going to overly
because i'm calling the second pair of up what's inside the same mean they're getting a little late but i have a better way of doing the comparison
i that i get the following display
just months between linear and quite right
and i can see the difference between cupid an exponential an interesting me
gotta realize that
choo big early on actually grows a little bit faster than exponential but after some point and special takes off and really overwhelmed
how does have the same time i should be careful about comparing these two graphs as this one only goes up to nine hundred that and goes up two hundred forty thousand
part of a message for you here i want to compare things i need to think about what i'm caring but it gives me a way of actually doing that visualization a very nice wait so there
sometimes when i want to overly things on the same window and other times when i wanted just have them display side by side
i can do
now that i'm starting to do other displays on top of things i could also add that help you cope with his twitch
michael winner
what what's happy label and i can do that
and in particular
i can add him a label for
i'm using a key word label and them equal side and the specific label to put on each one of them and i'm pretty obvious labels year
i'm on a label
one of these plots so that now and i disappointed
i'm gonna get a nice display out
one more thing before i do them i need to decide where am i up with
it actually given a location where giving under the plot function legend the key word look for location
this
now
he
you
now
wow
two
yeah
wow
you
me
why
yeah
worth
we'll see how are you
murray
i'll
real are in us
new year's eve
new jersey
all
patients
murray for it
cause over here on didn't know you are you guys you never was
well
no
oh
you
true
wow
wow
whew
wow
there
there there
wow
wow what
wow
wow
if
well i love her
i use this you
