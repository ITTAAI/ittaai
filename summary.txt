Understanding is closely tied to the ability to change one's perspective, specifically in the context of mathematics. Mathematics involves finding patterns and representing them. By changing perspectives, new patterns can be discovered and represented in different ways.

For example, consider the concept of a straight line. When repeated, it creates a curve known as a parabola. By extending and rotating the lines, the true pattern emerges, and it can be represented by a simple equation. This process of finding patterns and representing them is at the core of mathematics.

Changing perspectives is not limited to mathematics alone; it applies to various aspects of life as well. By approaching concepts from different angles, one can gain a deeper understanding.

Empathy is closely connected to understanding. When we view the world from another person's perspective, we can develop empathy and gain a better understanding of their experiences. This
