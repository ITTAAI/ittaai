And in fact, we'll see that right here
on this side when I want to put labels in.
I'm reopening that for window and doing
the appropriate labeling inside of it.
But with that clear, I'm actually
going to be able to draw appropriately
inside each of them.
And when I do that, I get the display I want.
Titles, in this case, on the windows,
but nothing on the axes.
And I should have said earlier, of course
there were actually four windows that were displayed here.
I'm just showing two of them, the linear and quadratic.
I didn't bother to show to you the cubic and the exponential.
But those are going to be things that would also be displayed.
If I wanted to look at them.
