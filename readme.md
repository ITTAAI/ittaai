## Inspiration

While attending classes, I noticed numerous international students struggling to keep pace with lectures. The challenge of grasping the spoken content, especially in large lecture halls or in cases of unclear audio, led me to identify a crucial need for real-time audio-to-text solutions in educational settings.

## What it does

"Ittaai" offers a cutting-edge tool that provides students with real-time audio subtitles. By converting the spoken word into written text, it ensures that students can visually follow along with the lecture, enhancing comprehension and note-taking.

## How we built it

Utilizing advanced AI technologies, we created a platform that can accurately transcribe live lectures. We integrated state-of-the-art speech recognition software to capture and transcribe lecture content in real-time, ensuring students never miss a word.

## Challenges we ran into

Achieving seamless real-time transcription, especially in environments with background noise or multiple speakers, was a significant challenge. Further, understanding and transcribing specialized academic jargon accurately was another hurdle we had to overcome.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Successfully developing a system that transcribes lectures in real-time is an accomplishment we cherish. The feedback from students, especially those who have hearing challenges or are non-native speakers, has been overwhelmingly positive.

## What we learned

We learned the value of real-time accessibility tools in education. Ensuring that every student has the means to understand lectures fully is invaluable. This project also gave us in-depth insights into the world of real-time speech recognition and its application in a classroom environment.

## What's next for Ittaai

Our vision for Ittaai includes refining the transcription accuracy further and adding features like topic segmentation and keyword highlighting. We also aim to make Ittaai compatible across various educational platforms, ensuring every student can benefit from this tool.
